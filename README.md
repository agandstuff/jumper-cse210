# Jumper
Are you familiar with Hangman from when you were young? Then jumper is going to introduce you to a new way to play this game. 

Our jumper is trying to land safely but needs your help! Guess correct letters to find the codeword, but be careful! Incorrect guesses will pop the parachutes our jumper is relying on!

## Getting Started
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```

```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.
